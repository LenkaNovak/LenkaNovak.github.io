    My work focuses on mid-latitude storm tracks and their interaction with the associated eddy-driven jet streams. I use idealised simulations of the global atmosphere combined with observations, in order to develop theoretical understanding for extreme weather under the current, past and future climates.

## Climate Modelling Alliance (CliMA)

As a member of the Caltech CliMA team, I am involved in verification of [ClimateMachine.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl), a comprehensive state-of-the-art earth system driven by machine learning that CliMA is currently developing.
