    <p> My work focuses on mid-latitude storm tracks and their interaction with the associated eddy-driven jet streams. I use idealised simulations of the global atmosphere combined with observations, in order to develop theoretical understanding for extreme weather under the current, past and future climates. </p>

    <h6>Jet shifts in latitude are modulated by growth of storms</h6>
    <p>
      The positions of the midlatitude jet, averaged over the North Atlantic sector, can be categorised into three main clusters, referred to as the South, Middle and North jet regimes. Using reanalysis data (global observations stitched together by the ECMWF model) we found that these jet regimes are highly correlated with features of eddy lifecycles, including their growth rate, vertical tilt, horizontal tilt and shape. We found that the preferred regime cycling from S to M to N to S, is often related to the explosive cyclone growth upstream of the jet fluctuations.

## Climate Modelling Alliance (CliMA)

As a member of the Caltech CliMA team, I am involved in verification of [ClimateMachine.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl), a comprehensive state-of-the-art earth system driven by machine learning that CliMA is currently developing.
