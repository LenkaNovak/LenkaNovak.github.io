## Media info

Here is a collection of info I found useful when talking to media and giving general public engagement talks:
- [Ozone](media_pages/Ozone.md)
- [CO2](media_pages/carbon_dioxide.md)
- [Sea-level rise](media_pages/Sea_level.md)
- [Global warming and regional climate change](media_pages/Climate_change.md)
- [Global circulation](media_pages/Global_circulation.md)

##Â Past engagement
- [KPCC radio interview](https://scpr.org/programs/take-two/2019/09/23/20145/) on listeners' questions on climate change
- [CSM on new generation climate modelling](https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2021/0122/Lenka-Novak-Learning-to-never-introduce-yourself-as-a-climate-modeler)
