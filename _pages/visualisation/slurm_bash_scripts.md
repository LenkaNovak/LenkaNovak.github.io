These are examples of useful scripts for visualising output from ClimateMachine.jl

##Â VizCLIMA scripts for stand alone analysis of NetCDF files
- General
  - file load + info
  - file splitting
  - performance info table
- GCM
  - basic zonal mean / slice output (debugging )
  - 1d, 2d spectra
  - animations
- LES
