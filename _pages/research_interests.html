<div class="content">
  Midlatitude weather is primarily controlled by large-scale turbulence, which determines extreme weather (weather bombs, extreme precipitation, gustiness, aircraft turbulence in upper atmosphere) and long-term conditions (heat waves, droughts). Understanding and good prediction of its behaviour can therefore save lives, avoid property damage, and mitigate loss to the agricultural, transport and energy industries.
