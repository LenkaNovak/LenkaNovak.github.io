## Sea level rise

- Average sea levels have swelled over 8 inches (about 23 cm) since 1880, with about three of those inches gained in the last 25 years, *accelerating rate*
- if all ice on land melts > 200ft, (30ft in Greenland)
- thermal expansion accounts for 25% of SL rise
- 40% population affected by flooding that will get worse due to SL rise
- Currently 3.5 mm/year
- Flooding 3-9 times worse in US than it was just 50 years ago.
- Measurement methods: SL is primarily measured using tide stations and satellite laser altimeters
- Impact: frequent flooding, sea surges during storms, existential crisis (e.g. Bangladesh, Maldives)
- Predictions: rise between 10 and 30 inches (26 to 77 centimeters) by 2100 with temperatures warming 1.5 Â°C
