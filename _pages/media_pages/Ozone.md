## Climate Change Facts

- **History**
    - measurements started in 1957 - international geophysical year, Satellite data (TOMS)
    - First paper (Farman, Gardiner & Shanklin, 1985)
    - 1986-87 papers on chemistry + importance of high altitude clouds (Solomon, McElroy, Crutzen & Arnold) 
    - 1987: Montreal Protocol (ratified by 196 countries) on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (to regulate and later phase out CFCs from refrigeration and propellant devices)
    - 1988: flight observations - direct correlations between lack of ozone and chlorine monoxide from CFCs 
    - One Dobson Unit = the number of molecules of O3 that required to form a layer of pure O3 0.01 millimeters thick at a temperature of 0 deg C at 1mb
- **Mechanism**
    - CFC (50–100 yr lifetime)—> into stratsphere where UV lets Cl to break away —> Cl joins to form HCl, and ClN3 to form a long term (stable) reservoir 
    - winter polar vortex and cold T form clouds whose surfaces renable reactions to more unstable compounds, i.e. Cl2, so when UV appears in spring Cl2 breaks down and Cl atoms attack 1000s of O3 modecules until vortex breaks down and T warm up
    - bromine also important catalyst
    - Equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) = parameter for amount of stratospheric 33 depletion
- **Ozone hole recovery**
    - First direct evidence: 20 % less O3 depletion between 2005 and 2016 (NASA’s Aura satellite)
    - chlorine levels are declining on average by about <%1 percent annually
    - will take decades to recover
    - CFC related by HFC but these are also GHGs
    - will take until 2060-80 until recovery
