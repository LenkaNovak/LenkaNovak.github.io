## Overview
This talks demonstrated how different balances of processes acting on windstorms need to be considered, depending on their timescales. For example, bi-weekly to monthly fluctuations in storm intensity can be approximately viewed as a result of the competing forces of north-south temperature contrast increasing storm growth rate and the stormsâ€™ mixing effect that decreases the temperature contrast and thus their own growth rate. However, on seasonal timescales, fluctuations in eddy growth are substantially modified by the seasonal large-scale circulation changes. We use an aquaplanet model to show those changes.
